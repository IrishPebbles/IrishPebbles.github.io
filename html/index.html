				<li><h3>The Teacher</h3></li>
					<p>I really enjoy learning new things, and helping others to do the same. Currently I teach a crochet class three Saturdays a month. My students are amazing! I also really enjoy tutoring Algebra and pre-Algebra. As I've taught over the years I've had to develop my patience and my ability to approach a problem from different angles: not everyone learns the same!</p>
				<li><h3>The Developer</h3></li>
					<p>My first CS class was in 2010. I had an AS in Mathematics at the time, and no desire to get my BS in same. I took an Intro to Computer Science course and was fascintated. Over the next 2 years I worked on my BS in CS. As it sometimes does, life got in the way and I found myself in HR instead of development.
					<br><br>
					In 2017, I found my way back to Software Development with <a href="https://www.grandcircus.co/">Grand Circus</a> and their Java Bootcamp. My love for development having been renewed, I'm currently building new projects with my new skills. </p>
