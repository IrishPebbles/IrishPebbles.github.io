				<td>I really enjoy learning new things, and helping others to do the same. Currently I teach a crochet class three Saturdays a month. My students are amazing! I also really enjoy tutoring Algebra and pre-Algebra. As I've taught over the years I've had to develop my patience and my ability to approach a problem from different angles: not everyone learns the same!</td>
